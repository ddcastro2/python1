# Description: This file is for the second day of the python workshop


# create variables for the following :
# 1. age
age = 30
# 2. name
name = "John"
# 3. song
song = "Custer"
# 4. food
food = "orange peels"
# 5. number
number = 750
priceOfMovie = 10.99 #this is a float
# #now include the variables you just made print in the following...
print (f'''Once upon a time, there was {age} year old coder named {name}.
{name} liked to hum the song {song} while coding. It was so annoying that their teammates would
throw {food} until {name} would stop singing.
Still, {name} was the best coder on the team and could write {number} lines of code every day.
Maybe {song} was {name}â€™s secret power?
No one will ever know.''')

# f string interpolation is a way to format strings in python
# it allows you to use variables inside of strings
# What is syntax ? A way of writing code that is correct and fast
#What is an algorithm? A set of instructions that used to solve a problem
# what is a variable? What is a string? Variables hold datra, strings are nothing but plain textr

# strings are nothing but plain text
# what does this do?
print("Giraffe \nacademy")
#\n makes a new line
# or this
print ("Giraffe \t academy")
#\t makes a tab
phrase = "python learning"
print(phrase + "is cool")
#this is called concatenation or string interpolation
#what does the + sign do? What is it called?
#it adds two strings together 
phrase = str(phrase)

#what if I wanted to get the length of a phrase?
print (f'the length of the phrase" +len(phrase)')
declarationOfInDependence = "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed, by their Creator, with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."
#what if I wanted to make the letters in the variable upper case or lower?
print ('f"the length of the declaration is" + len(declarationOfInDependence'))
#len allows you to find the length of a string



#what if I wanted to check and see if the phrase was all lower or upper?


#What if I wanted to get one letter of the phrase


# The names you use when creating these labels need to follow a few rules:
# 1. Names can not start with a number.
# 2. There can be no spaces in the name, use _ instead.
# 3. Can't use any of these symbols :'",<>/?|()!@#$%^&*~-+
# 4. It's considered best practice (PEP8) that names are lowercase.
# 5. Avoid using the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh), or 'I' (uppercase
# letter eye) as single character variable names.



# Working with numbers bold text
# We'll learn about the following topics:
# 1. Types of Numbers in Python
# 2. Basic Arithmetic
# 3. Differences between classic division and floor division


# Addition

# Subtraction

# Multiplication

# Division

# Modulus

# Exponentiation

# Floor Division

# Order of Operations followed in Python

# You can use parentheses to specify the order in which you want operations to be performed.

#to do more you need to import special math libraries from python
#from math import *
#this goes out and grabs some different math functions we can use
#floor method
#ceil method
#sqrt method
from math import * #import everything
print(floor(95.76666))
print(ceil(98.3333))
print(sqrt(54))


# Python has various "types" of numbers (numeric literals).
# 1. We'll mainly focus on integers and floating point numbers. Integers are just whole numbers,
# positive or negative. For example: 2 and -2 are examples of integers.
# 2. Floating point numbers in Python are notable because they have a decimal point in them, or
# use an exponential (e) to define the number. For example 2.0 and -2.1 are examples of
# floating point numbers. 4E2 (4 times 10 to the power of 2) is also an example of a floating
# point number in Python.

# Given the phrase "Hancock High School", perform the following operations:
# Print the phrase with a newline character to separate "Hancock" and "High" and "School".
# Concatenate the phrase with " is cool", and print the result.
# Print the length of the phrase.
# Convert and print the phrase in uppercase and lowercase.
# Check if the phrase is all lower or all upper and print the result.
# Print the first and the last letter of the phrase.
